# Audit Recommendation: _templates/TEMPLATE.dlg

## Audit Summary
Dialog files are verbose and brittle, but this template follows standard syntax.

## Findings

### 1. Stata Version `[Low]`
- **Location:** Line 1.
- **Issue:** `VERSION 16.0`.
- **Recommendation:** Consistent with the rest of the package.

## Recommendations

1.  **Add Layout Managers?**
    - Stata dialogs don't really have layout managers, but suggesting relative positioning (which is used) is good. The template is fine.
