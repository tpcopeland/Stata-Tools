# Audit Recommendation: _templates/README.md

## Audit Summary
The README accurately describes the templates.

## Findings

### 1. Missing Dialog Guidance `[Low]`
- **Location:** Dialog Section.
- **Issue:** Dialogs are rarely used in modern Stata development compared to simple syntax. The guide dedicates significant space to them.
- **Recommendation:** Mark Dialogs as "Optional/Advanced" to avoid overwhelming new developers.

## Recommendations

1.  **Add "Quick Start" Snippet:**
    - Provide a one-liner copy-paste to set up a new command immediately.
