# Audit Recommendation: _templates/TEMPLATE.sthlp

## Audit Summary
SMCL help files are tedious. This template provides good headers.

## Findings

### 1. Missing `version` in syntax diagram `[Low]`
- **Location:** Syntax section.
- **Issue:** Sometimes it's helpful to denote if a specific version is required, though usually handled in description.

## Recommendations

1.  **Structure `Stored results`:**
    - The breakdown into Scalars/Macros/Matrices is good. Check alignment tabs.

2.  **Add `Dialog` link:**
    - If a dialog exists, include `{dialog TEMPLATE}` in the header or descriptions.
