Description: Provides comprehensive tools for managing time-varying exposures
    in longitudinal and survival analysis. The package implements three main
    functions: tvexpose() for creating time-varying exposure variables from
    period-based data, tvmerge() for merging multiple time-varying datasets
    using Cartesian product of overlapping periods, and tvevent() for
    integrating outcome events and competing risks. Originally developed as
    Stata commands, this R implementation maintains API compatibility while
    leveraging R's data manipulation capabilities.
