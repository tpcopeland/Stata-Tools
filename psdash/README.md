# psdash — Propensity Score Diagnostics Dashboard

**Version 1.0.1** | 2026-05-06

Unified diagnostics dashboard for propensity score analyses in Stata. After `teffects`, after `logit`/`probit` with manually supplied propensity scores from `predict`, or in fully manual mode, `psdash` assesses the four standard PS diagnostic domains through one command family: overlap between treatment groups (`psdash overlap`), covariate balance before and after weighting (`psdash balance`), weight distribution and effective sample size (`psdash weights`), and common-support regions (`psdash support`). `psdash combined` runs all four and produces a consolidated dashboard.

This package exists because PS diagnostics in Stata are scattered across `tebalance`, user-written helpers, and ad-hoc `summarize`/`tabstat` calls, with each step requiring the analyst to re-specify the treatment variable, covariate list, PS variable, and weighting scheme. `psdash` collapses that friction: when called after `teffects`, it reads treatment, covariates, propensity scores, and the implied weighting scheme (ATE/ATT/ATC) directly from `e()`. After `logit`/`probit` it still pulls treatment and covariates from the estimation context. In fully manual mode, treatment and PS are passed explicitly; `covariates()` and `wvar()` are supplied to the subcommands that use those inputs. Auto-generated propensity scores and IPTW weights are created as temporary working variables and are not left behind in the user's dataset.

Balance reporting is deliberately richer than the `tebalance summarize` default. `psdash balance` computes raw and weighted standardized mean differences, variance ratios, Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics, and a Love plot sorted by absolute SMD, with configurable thresholds and Excel export. When a PS is available, it auto-generates IPTW weights for the requested `estimand()` (default ATE) and displays adjusted columns alongside raw columns, so the user sees immediately how much weighting resolves any imbalance — with `nowvar` to suppress weighting and `wvar()` to supply a pre-computed weight variable. Factor and interaction notation (`i.var`, `c.var`, `##`) is expanded transparently when balance is auto-detected from a fitted `logit`/`probit`/`teffects` model.

The weights subcommand is the complement. `psdash weights` reports mean, SD, range, percentiles, effective sample size, and extreme-weight counts, with on-the-fly `trim(#)`, `truncate(#)`, and `stabilize` modifications exposed through `generate(name)` so the modified weights are kept as a new variable rather than overwriting the original. `psdash support` assesses common-support regions via manual PS thresholds or the Crump et al. (2009) optimal-trimming rule and can write an `in_support` indicator for downstream analyses. All subcommands store results in `r()` and the dashboard output lines use clear status labels plus a "Consider:" action line when follow-up is warranted.

## Installation

```stata
* Released version from GitHub:
capture ado uninstall psdash
net install psdash, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpcopeland/Stata-Tools/main/psdash") replace

* Development install from a local checkout:
capture ado uninstall psdash
net install psdash, from("/path/to/psdash") replace
```

## How It Works

`psdash` is designed to work in four modes:

- **After `teffects`**: treatment, covariates, propensity scores, and the implied weighting scheme are auto-detected from `e()`. This is the shortest workflow: fit `teffects`, then run `psdash combined` or one of the individual subcommands.
- **After `logit`/`probit`**: treatment and covariates are read from the estimation context, but you still supply the PS variable created by `predict`.
- **After `mlogit` (multi-group)**: for multi-valued treatments, treatment and covariates are auto-detected from `e()`. Run `predict ps1 ps2 ps3, pr` and pass the GPS variables via `psvars(ps1 ps2 ps3)`.
- **Manual mode**: provide treatment and PS explicitly, then pass `covariates()` to balance/combined and `wvar()` to balance/weights/combined when you want to override auto-detection.

When a PS variable is available, `psdash balance` auto-generates IPTW weights for the requested `estimand()` unless you suppress that with `nowvar` or provide `wvar()` yourself.
Auto-generated propensity scores and weights are temporary working variables and are not left behind in the user's dataset.

## What Should I Run?

Most users can start with `psdash combined`. It runs the four diagnostic panels together and prints an overall status line. If one panel raises a caution, rerun that subcommand by itself to inspect the graph, export a table, or create a modified weight/support variable.

| Question | Command | What to look for |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| Do treated and control observations have comparable propensity scores? | `psdash overlap` | Large percentages outside common support, very high AUC, PS values near 0 or 1 |
| Are the covariates balanced after adjustment? | `psdash balance` | Maximum absolute SMD above `threshold()`; variance ratios outside 0.5 to 2.0; large KS statistics |
| Are a few observations dominating the weighted analysis? | `psdash weights` | Low ESS, high coefficient of variation, weights above 10 or 20 |
| Which observations are inside the usable support region? | `psdash support` | Number outside empirical common support and number trimmed by `crump` or `threshold()` |
| Do I need the full dashboard in one step? | `psdash combined` | Overall PASS/CAUTION plus the panel named in the warning |

## Reading the Output

`psdash` uses the same diagnostics that are common in propensity-score reporting, but it labels the output so a non-specialist can follow the next action:

- **Overlap/support warnings** mean the treatment groups do not share enough comparable observations in part of the propensity-score range. Consider trimming, narrowing the study population, changing the estimand, or revisiting the PS model.
- **Balance warnings** mean one or more observed covariates still differ after adjustment. Consider model revisions, additional covariates or interactions, a different weighting scheme, or reporting the residual imbalance explicitly.
- **Weight warnings** mean the estimated effect may be sensitive to a small number of observations. Consider stabilized weights, percentile trimming, truncation, or an estimand with better support.
- **A PASS or Adequate label is not a causal proof.** It means these observed-diagnostic thresholds were not crossed. Outcome-model assumptions, unmeasured confounding, missing data, and study design still need separate judgment.

## Worked Examples

The README keeps one binary and one multi-group workflow. The installed help file (`help psdash`) remains the authoritative source for complete examples, including `teffects`, ATT, pre-computed weights, focused option examples, and stored-result details. Full demo console transcripts are linked in the [Demo](#demo) section instead of embedded here.

### 1. Binary manual workflow with `sysuse auto`

Estimate the propensity score with `logit`, save fitted probabilities in `ps`, then run each diagnostic explicitly. Because this is a manual workflow, `balance` is told which covariates to assess.

```stata
sysuse auto, clear
logit foreign mpg weight length
predict double ps, pr
psdash overlap foreign ps
psdash balance foreign ps, covariates(mpg weight length) loveplot
psdash weights foreign ps
psdash support foreign ps, crump generate(in_support)
```

After `logit` or `probit`, treatment and covariates are still available in `e()`, so commands that need only the propensity score can also be called as `psdash overlap ps`, `psdash balance ps, loveplot`, and `psdash weights ps`.

### 2. Multi-group treatment with `mlogit`

When the treatment has more than two levels, estimate generalized propensity scores and pass the K predicted probabilities through `psvars()`.

```stata
clear
set obs 300
set seed 20260506
gen double age = rnormal(60, 10)
gen byte female = runiform() > .5
gen double bmi = rnormal(27, 4)
gen double eta1 = -0.2 + 0.03*(age-60) + 0.25*female - 0.04*(bmi-27)
gen double eta2 = 0.1 - 0.02*(age-60) + 0.02*(bmi-27)
gen double den = 1 + exp(eta1) + exp(eta2)
gen double p0 = 1/den
gen double p1 = exp(eta1)/den
gen double u = runiform()
gen byte arm = cond(u < p0, 0, cond(u < p0 + p1, 1, 2))

mlogit arm age female bmi
predict double ps0 ps1 ps2, pr
psdash overlap arm, psvars(ps0 ps1 ps2)
psdash balance arm, psvars(ps0 ps1 ps2) covariates(age female bmi)
psdash weights arm, psvars(ps0 ps1 ps2) detail
psdash support arm, psvars(ps0 ps1 ps2) threshold(0.1)
psdash balance arm, psvars(ps0 ps1 ps2) covariates(age female bmi) reference(1)
```

For the automatic `teffects` workflow, ATT handling, pre-computed weights, and focused option examples, run `help psdash` after installation.

## Subcommands

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `overlap` | PS density/histogram by treatment group |
| `balance` | SMD balance table + Love plot |
| `weights` | Weight distribution, ESS, extreme weights, trim/stabilize |
| `support` | Common support assessment, Crump optimal trimming |
| `combined` | All diagnostics in a combined dashboard |

## Key Options

### Common and multi-group options
- `estimand(ate|att|atc)` - target estimand for generated weights. Default is `ate`; after `teffects`, the value is read from `e(stat)` unless supplied explicitly.
- `psvars(varlist)` - generalized propensity scores for multi-group treatments. Provide one probability variable per treatment level, ordered by ascending treatment value.
- `reference(#)` - reference treatment level for pairwise multi-group balance and weight summaries. Default is the smallest observed treatment level.
- `saving(filename)` - save the graph produced by the relevant subcommand. For `combined`, this saves the combined dashboard graph.
- `scheme(schemename)`, `title(string)`, `name(string)`, `graphoptions(string)` - graph styling options where supported by the subcommand.

### overlap
- `histogram` - use overlapping histograms instead of kernel density plots
- `bins(#)` - histogram bins; default is 30
- `bwidth(#)` - kernel density bandwidth; Stata's default is used when omitted
- `nograph` - show the overlap table without drawing a graph

### balance
- `covariates(varlist)` — covariates to assess (auto-detected if omitted)
- `wvar(varname)` — weight variable (auto-generated from PS if omitted)

> **Default behavior:** When a PS is supplied, `balance` auto-generates IPTW weights for the requested `estimand()` (default: ATE) and displays *adjusted* SMD/VR columns alongside the raw columns. Pass `nowvar` to see raw balance only, or `wvar()` to supply a pre-computed weight variable.
- `matched` - report matched/unweighted balance; mutually exclusive with `wvar()`
- `nowvar`, `noweights` - suppress automatic weight generation and show raw balance only
- `loveplot` — generate Love plot
- `threshold(#)` — SMD threshold (default: 0.1)
- `ks` - display Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics; KS values are stored either way
- `xlsx(filename)` — export to Excel
- `sheet(string)` - Excel sheet name; default is `"Balance"`
- `format(string)` - numeric display format for SMD values; default is `%6.3f`

### weights
- `wvar(varname)` — weight variable (auto-generated from PS if omitted)
- `trim(#)` — trim at percentile (50–99.9)
- `truncate(#)` — cap at fixed value
- `stabilize` — create stabilized weights
- `generate(name)` — variable for modified weights
- `replace` - allow `generate()` to replace an existing variable
- `detail` — show percentile distribution
- `graph` — weight distribution histogram
- `xlabel(numlist)` - custom x-axis labels for the histogram

### support
- `crump` — Crump et al. (2009) optimal trimming
- `threshold(#)` — manual PS trimming threshold (0–0.5)
- `generate(name)` — create an in-support indicator. With `crump` or `threshold()`, this marks the trimmed region; otherwise it marks the empirical common-support interval.
- `replace` - allow `generate()` to replace an existing variable
- `nograph` - show the support table without drawing a graph

### combined
- `nooverlap`, `nobalance`, `noweights`, `nosupport` — suppress panels

## Stored Results

Each subcommand stores results in `r()`. Technical users can use these values in QA checks, automated reports, or decision rules.

| Subcommand | Key scalars/macros | Matrix |
|------------|--------------------|--------|
| `overlap` | `r(N)`, `r(overlap_lower)`, `r(overlap_upper)`, `r(n_outside)`, `r(pct_outside)`, `r(auc)`, `r(treatment)`, `r(psvar)` | none |
| `balance` | `r(max_smd_raw)`, `r(max_smd_adj)`, `r(max_vr_raw)`, `r(max_vr_adj)`, `r(max_ks_raw)`, `r(n_imbalanced)`, `r(threshold)`, `r(wvar)` | `r(balance)` |
| `weights` | `r(mean_wt)`, `r(sd_wt)`, `r(cv)`, `r(ess)`, `r(ess_pct)`, `r(n_extreme)`, `r(p1)`, `r(p99)`, `r(generate)` | none |
| `support` | `r(lower_bound)`, `r(upper_bound)`, `r(n_outside)`, `r(pct_outside)`, `r(trim_lower)`, `r(trim_upper)`, `r(n_trimmed)`, `r(crump_alpha)` | none |
| `combined` | Inherits subcommand results via `return add`; also stores `r(treatment)`, `r(psvar)`, `r(estimand)`, `r(source)`, and for multi-group runs `r(K)`, `r(levels)`, `r(reference)` | inherited when balance runs |

For binary treatments, `r(balance)` has one row per covariate and columns for raw and adjusted means, SMDs, variance ratios, and KS statistics. For multi-group treatments, `r(balance)` has one five-column block per non-reference group, plus adjusted blocks when weights are applied; column names include the compared treatment levels.

Example:

```stata
psdash balance foreign ps, covariates(mpg weight length)
return list
matrix list r(balance)
* Example decision rule for your own analysis:
* assert r(max_smd_adj) < 0.1
```

## Relationship to Existing Packages

`psdash balance` incorporates the computation from [`balancetab`](../balancetab/) and `psdash weights` from [`iptw_diag`](../iptw_diag/). Both use identical methods. The `overlap` and `support` subcommands are new.
