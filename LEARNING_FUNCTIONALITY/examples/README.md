# Examples Directory

This directory contains examples of how the learning functionality system works in practice.

## Example Files (To Be Added)

When you start using this system, save examples here:

1. **Example Development Log**
   - `example_development_log.md` - A completed log showing error documentation

2. **Example Test File**
   - `example_test_command.do` - A well-structured test file

3. **Example Skill Invocation**
   - Screenshots or transcripts of skill routing in action

## Creating Examples

### Development Log Example

After your first package development session:

1. Copy your completed log from `_resources/logs/`
2. Rename to `example_development_log.md`
3. Anonymize if needed
4. Add commentary about what worked

### Test File Example

A good test file demonstrates:

- Clear structure with sections
- Multiple test cases
- Error case testing
- Success/failure messages

### Session Transcript Example

Document a session that shows:

1. Hook firing at session start
2. Skill routing detection
3. Skill invocation
4. Error correction
5. Log creation

## Using Examples for Onboarding

When bringing new collaborators up to speed:

1. Walk through the example development log
2. Show how errors lead to pattern documentation
3. Demonstrate skill invocation
4. Explain the learning cycle

## Continuous Improvement

As you use the system:

- Add new examples that illustrate common patterns
- Update examples when the system changes
- Remove outdated examples
